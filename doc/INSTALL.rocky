The following is a brief overview of the building and installing instructions for for Rocky Linux 9 
(and presumably other compatible RPM Enterprise Linux distros).

For full instructions on how to build and install Motion, see the motion_guide.html that is
distributed with this source code. The guide also includes instructions for building Motion
on distributions other than debian/ubuntu such as BSD, Mac and Centos.

The packages and library names change frequently and vary across base operating systems.
Adjust the following lines as required by the base operating system.

Install buildessential equivalents
    Minimal:
    sudo dnf --setopt="install_weak_deps=False" install \
         gcc \
         gcc-c++ \
         make

    Extensive, but major cruft:
    sudo dnf --setopt="install_weak_deps=False" groupinstall "Development Tools"

Install necessary additional build tools and support packages:
    sudo dnf --setopt="install_weak_deps=False" install \
        autoconf \
        automake \
        autopoint \
        pkgconf \
        libtool \
        libjpeg-devel \
        libzip-devel \
        gettext \
        gettext-devel \
        libmicrohttpd-devel

Install FFMPEG packages
    sudo apt-get install libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libavutil-dev libswscale-dev libavdevice-dev

Once the packages have been installed, continue as for the default (.deb system) compilation:
    autoreconf -fiv
    ./configure
    make
    make install

Sample custom configuration options:
    --prefix               :  Specify the install location for the motion package
    --with-ffmpeg=[dir]    :  Specify the location in which ffmpeg/libav is installed.
